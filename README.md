# Udemy-Courses-Analysis(2011---2016)
Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing Udemy course trends, profitability, and audience engagement.
Overview:
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard based on Udemy courses data. The analysis covers over 3,600 published courses and 12 million subscribers. I started by ensuring the dataset was clean and valid using Python, then developed a dynamic dashboard in Power BI to extract insights about course trends, audience preferences, and content levels.

Key Insights:

Most profitable courses by title

Distribution of course levels (Beginner, Intermediate, All Levels, Expert)

Paid vs. Free courses percentage

Subject-wise popularity (based on reviews and subscribers)

Course volume and lecture counts by level
